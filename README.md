# AnimationLoop
AnimationLoop.js is a javascript class used to create a loop for games or animations.

## Quick Start

#### 1) Create a function for your animation
```javascript
function animation(elapsed) {
   // ...
}
```

#### 2) Create an instance of AnimationLoop and pass the function as a parameter 
```javascript
const animationLoop = new AnimationLoop(animation);
```

#### 3) Start the loop
```javascript
animationLoop.start();
```

## API

### new AnimationLoop(callback)

### start()
Start the loop. The callback function is called each usually 60 times per second,  but will generally match the display 
refresh rate.

### stop()
Stop the loop.
